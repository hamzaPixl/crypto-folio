## Config your Wallet

  > Before starting it go to `src/config/wallet/` and remove files correspondig to crypto that you don't want to track. If you want to add a new crypto for traking you have to create a new file corresponding to your crypto.

  **Example**   
      
  > You want to track the crypto **Stellar**
  
  **Logo**    
      
  > For some style you have to add a logo for you cryptocurrency. Add the file in `src/assets/icons/coins/xlm.svg`
  
  > We support different type of logo but **SVG** is better.
  
  **Information**   
      
  > Add a file named `src/config/wallet/xlm.js` or whatever you want. The content is something like this. when **XXX** is how   much you hold in this cryptocurrency.
  
  > All keys are required.
  
  > Add the file into `src/config/wallet/index.js` and export it.
